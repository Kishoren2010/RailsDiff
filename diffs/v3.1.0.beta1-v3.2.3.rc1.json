The model contains the \"smart\" domain objects (such as Account,\n-Product, Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to\n-persist themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming requests\n-(such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model\n-and directing data to the view.\n-\n-In Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\n-layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\n-database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\n-methods. You can read more about Active Record in\n-link:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n-\n-The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\n-layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\n-are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\n-unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\n-more separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\n-Rails. You can read more about Action Pack in\n-link:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n-\n-\n-== Getting Started\n-\n-1. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:\n-       <tt>rails new myapp</tt> (where <tt>myapp</tt> is the application name)\n-\n-2. Change directory to <tt>myapp</tt> and start the web server:\n-       <tt>cd myapp; rails server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n-\n-3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see:\n-       \"Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!\"\n-\n-4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You can find\n-the following resources handy:\n-\n-* The Getting Started Guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html\n-* Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book: http://www.railstutorial.org/\n-\n-\n-== Debugging Rails\n-\n-Sometimes your application goes wrong. Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\n-will help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n-\n-First area to check is the application log files. Have \"tail -f\" commands\n-running on the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display\n-debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be\n-shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n-\n-You can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code\n-using the Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n-\n-  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n-    def destroy\n-      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n-      @weblog.destroy\n-      logger.info(\"\#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID #\#{@weblog.id}!\")\n-    end\n-  end\n-\n-The result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n-\n-  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1!\n-\n-More information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n-\n-Also, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/. There are\n-several books available online as well:\n-\n-* Programming Ruby: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/ (Pickaxe)\n-* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/ (a beginners guide)\n-\n-These two books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language and also on\n-programming in general.\n-\n-\n-== Debugger\n-\n-Debugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your\n-Mongrel or WEBrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of\n-execution at any point in the code, investigate and change the model, and then,\n-resume execution! You need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging\n-mode. With gems, use <tt>sudo gem install ruby-debug</tt>. Example:\n-\n-  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n-    def index\n-      @posts = Post.all\n-      debugger\n-    end\n-  end\n-\n-So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\n-with a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n-\n-  >> @posts.inspect\n-  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8\n-          @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>,\n-       #<Post:0x14a6620\n-          @attributes={\"title\"=>\"Rails\", \"body\"=>\"Only ten..\", \"id\"=>\"2\"}>]\"\n-  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n-  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n-\n-...and even better, you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n-\n-  >> f = @posts.first\n-  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n-  >> f.\n-  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n-\n-Finally, when you're ready to resume execution, you can enter \"cont\".\n-\n-\n-== Console\n-\n-The console is a Ruby shell, which allows you to interact with your\n-application's domain model. Here you'll have all parts of the application\n-configured, just like it is when the application is running. You can inspect\n-domain models, change values, and save to the database. Starting the script\n-without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\n-\n-To start the console, run <tt>rails console</tt> from the application\n-directory.\n-\n-Options:\n-\n-* Passing the <tt>-s, --sandbox</tt> argument will rollback any modifications\n-  made to the database.\n-* Passing an environment name as an argument will load the corresponding\n-  environment. Example: <tt>rails console production</tt>.\n-\n-To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run\n-<tt>reload!</tt>\n-\n-More information about irb can be found at:\n-link:http://www.rubycentral.org/pickaxe/irb.html\n-\n-\n-== dbconsole\n-\n-You can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>rails\n-dbconsole</tt>.
